# Next Steps for SC/ST Act Research Assistant

Now that the basic application is working with Gemini API integration, here are the next steps to enhance the functionality:

## 1. Document Processing

Once the basic application is confirmed to be working, we can add back the document processing functionality:

```python
# Add these imports
import glob
import PyPDF2
import docx
from pptx import Presentation
import json
import re
```

## 2. Simple Document Indexing

Add a simple document indexing system that doesn't rely on complex dependencies:

```python
# Global variables for document storage
DOCUMENTS = []
DOCUMENT_METADATA = []
INDEX_FILE = "document_index.json"

# Functions to add
def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    """Extract text from PDF files"""
    # Implementation...

def extract_text_from_docx(docx_path):
    """Extract text from Word documents"""
    # Implementation...

def extract_text_from_pptx(pptx_path):
    """Extract text from PowerPoint presentations"""
    # Implementation...

def chunk_text(text, chunk_size=1000, overlap=200):
    """Split text into overlapping chunks"""
    # Implementation...

def process_document(file_path):
    """Process a document and return chunked text"""
    # Implementation...

def load_or_create_index():
    """Load existing index or create a new one"""
    # Implementation...

def load_dataset():
    """Load and process the SC/ST Act dataset"""
    # Implementation...

def simple_keyword_search(query, top_k=5):
    """Simple keyword-based search"""
    # Implementation...
```

## 3. Web Search Integration

Add web search capabilities as a fallback when local documents don't have relevant information:

```python
# Add this import
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def search_internet(query):
    """Search the internet for relevant information"""
    # Implementation...
```

## 4. Enhanced Query Processing

Modify the query processing to use both local documents and web search:

```python
def query_assistant(user_query):
    """Process user query using dataset, Gemini, and internet search"""
    # Implementation...
```

## 5. Incremental Approach

1. First, add document processing without indexing
2. Then add simple indexing and keyword search
3. Finally add web search integration

This incremental approach will help identify any issues early and ensure the application remains stable.

## 6. Testing

Test each component thoroughly before moving to the next:

1. Test document processing with a small set of documents
2. Test keyword search with simple queries
3. Test web search with different queries
4. Test the complete system with complex queries

## 7. Error Handling

Ensure robust error handling at each step to provide clear feedback to users when issues occur.
